# Industrial City Case Study

## Objective
Develop a data-driven strategy and present key insights to optimize strategic initiatives within an innovation-driven economic zone

## Data
The dataset contains data related to utility requirements, job creation, worker compensation levels, GDP contribution, and infrastructure readiness for upcoming manufacturing tenant.

## Key Deliverables

### Data Analysis

- Identify clusters where utility demand will surpass capacity by 2025/2030 and suggest strategies to mitigate the risk.
- Identify clusters with the highest growth in job creation and GDP contribution.
- Assess the ROI on investments and incentives granted, identifying clusters with the highest and lowest returns.
- Cross-analyze infrastructure readiness with investment levels to determine if additional investments are needed for timely project completion.

### Visualization

- Dashboard 1: Utility and Land Utilization: Display current utility demand, capacity, and projected future demand. Overlay this with land area utilization and infrastructure readiness to identify critical bottlenecks.
- Dashboard 2: ROI and GDP Contribution: Display the projected ROI and GDP contribution for each cluster. Highlight the correlation between investment levels and the anticipated economic impact.
